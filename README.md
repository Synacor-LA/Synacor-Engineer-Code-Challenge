# Synacor Los Angeles Engineer II Code Challenge

Submission by Kyle Mayer on 3.14.19

Notes:
- This package should be locally from node using "npm start" due to ES6 modules not allowing CORS requests
- This package uses ES6 import modules by default but fallback code is provided
- The only dependencies are Babel Transform for ES6 modules (for Jest), Jest, and Express
