Code Challenge

Instructions for challenge: Open file with Live Server or extension that triggers JavaScript.

Instructions for test:
Open test/index.html in the browser.

Notes:

The Fetch Api uses promises and promise chains, avoiding the callback pyramid of doom || future callback hell(XMLHttp solution).

Exercised implementing ES6 modules in the html script tag without the need for Babel or Webpack. Although I could have just inserted the url's in the fetch call, it was good practice.
